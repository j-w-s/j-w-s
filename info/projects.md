# Applied ML: Pokemon VGC

## Applied data mining techniques for competitive team analysis and synthesis, constructing a model from scratch,  developing custom heuristics, scraping historical data and cleaning it appropriately, and training and refining my model to generate teams for a specified format, based on current meta trends and data.

# TShader

## Initially based on the decompilation of the Lights and Shadows mod, TShader is an open-source Terraria rendering engine, supporting various passes (bloom, etc) and custom HLSL shaders.

# Animal Adopt

## Led the development efforts of a full-stack social platform for animal adoption in Northern Louisiana. Architected front-end and back-end, providing guidance on Angular for unfamiliar team members, creating re-usable services and components, and managing individual tasks for group members based on ability.

# pinqy

## A recreation of Roslyn's enumerables for lazy evaluation and deferred execution in Python, extending utility significantly. Scaffolded test suite to extensively test and refine the library for performance, ergonomics, and accuracy.

# LOVE2D Engine

## Significant effort put towards scaffolding engine systems (AI, Lighting, Particles, Rendering, Physics, ECS, Markov Chains, an Iterator library with optimized chain fusion and monomorphization, Animation, UI, Noise, Matrix mat2-mat4, Vector vec2-vec4, etc), all optimized and tested extensively for the new Luajit compiler (targeting Lua 5.1 primarily, with immense utilization of IEEE 754 hex, SoA, FFI, etc) and base Lua 5.3+.

- Scaffolded comprehensive engine systems including ECS (Entity Component System), Physics, Lighting, and AI using Lua 5.1 (LuaJIT) and Lua 5.3+.
    
- Optimized performance heavily utilizing IEEE 754 hex, Structure of Arrays (SoA), and FFI (Foreign Function Interface).
    
- Developed a custom iterator library with chain fusion and monomorphization to ensure high-performance runtime execution.

# Lunet

## Implements custom protocol alternative to HTTP/HTTPS, custom minipack alternative -- lpack -- for more efficient data transport, custom client (with sandboxed environment for Lua) and server (with full router, serializer, and transport layer), custom immediate-mode GUI (Elm-/React-like) with LOVE2D as my back-end renderer, and custom Lua "DOM" replacing HTML, CSS, JS with Lua alone -- all in pure Lua.

- Architected a custom networking protocol and transport layer (`lpack`) as a high-efficiency alternative to HTTP/HTTPS for data transport.
    
- Developed a sandboxed client environment and a full-featured server with custom routing and serialization.
    
- Implemented an immediate-mode GUI and a custom DOM in pure Lua, replacing standard HTML/CSS stacks for specialized rendering.

# Mica

## A low-level, embeddable interpreted programming language alternative to Lua, with a significantly smaller virtual machine and instruction set. Supports closures, Rust-like, zero-cost abstractions via lazy, deferred iterators and traits with monomorphization and fusion, a register-based virtual machine, and many other features of more modern languages.

- Designed and implemented a functional-first embedded programming language with a register-based virtual machine and custom instruction set.
    
- Built a complete compiler pipeline (Lexer, AST, Bytecode Emission) featuring closure support, upvalue management, and reference-counted memory management.
    
- Engineered zero-cost abstractions via lazy iterators and traits with monomorphization and fusion, optimizing for a smaller footprint than Lua.
